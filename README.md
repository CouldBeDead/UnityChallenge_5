Unity Junior Programmer Pathway - Unit 5: UI and Reflex Game

What I Learned:
In Unit 5 of the Unity Junior Programmer Pathway, I built a reflex-based game where the player clicks and destroys objects launched into the air before they hit the ground. Through this project, I learned how to integrate essential UI elements into a Unity game to create a complete and replayable experience.

Here’s what I picked up while working on this unit:

How to create a main menu with a difficulty selection system that affects gameplay

How to display and update the score in real-time as the player earns points

How to implement a Game Over screen with a working restart button

The importance of clean UI design, like aligning button text and organizing menus clearly

Challenge Overview
For the challenge, I created a whack-a-mole-style game where food randomly pops up on a grid and the goal is to click it before it disappears—all while avoiding skulls that cause a game over. This challenge helped me apply my UI knowledge while also debugging player input, scoring systems, and difficulty settings.

Challenge Objectives Completed
All UI buttons display cleanly with properly aligned text

The spawn rate of food and skulls changes based on the selected difficulty

Clicking a food item destroys it and updates the score in the top-left

When the player loses, a restart button appears that resets the game

*Has Screenshot of test because it was a requirment for submition*
